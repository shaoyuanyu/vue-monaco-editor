# vue-monaco-editor

This project aims at packaging [Monaco Editor](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor) into a Vue3 component.

You can easily use this project in your own Vue3 project as a web code editor, which provides exactly the same experience as **vscode** thanks to **Monaco Editor**.
